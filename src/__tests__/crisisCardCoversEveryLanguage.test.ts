/**
 * The crisis card must appear in all 22 languages, on every platform.
 *
 * 🔴 MEASURED 2026-10-10, before this file existed. The web chat page and the
 * mobile chat screen each had their own tier-2 detector, and they disagreed:
 *
 *     web     covered  9 / 22 languages
 *     mobile  covered 22 / 22
 *
 * ⛔ Thirteen languages got NO crisis card on the web app — Gujarati, Odia,
 * Urdu, Arabic, Hebrew, Russian, Chinese, Japanese, Spanish, French, German,
 * Portuguese, Indonesian. Someone could type "quiero morir" or "我想死" into
 * imotara.com and see nothing, then type the same sentence on their phone and
 * get a helpline. Every one of those languages is advertised by the product.
 *
 * ⚠️ AND NOT ONLY ONE WAY. Mobile used CRISIS_HINT_REGEX alone and missed 16
 * phrases the web page caught, including the bare word "suicide".
 *
 * 🔑 So tier 2 is now the UNION of both, in `isCrisisTier2`. This file is what
 * stops it drifting again — and the mobile repo has the twin of this file,
 * built from the same list, because the two repos cannot share a test run.
 *
 * ⛔ A failure here is not a style problem. It means someone saying they want
 * to die is shown nothing.
