/**
 * P3-5 part two — the positive side of the WEB reply path.
 *
 * 🔴 WHY THIS EXISTS. Part one closed four SADNESS gaps. The positive side of
 * the same classifier turned out to be in worse shape, and for the same reason:
 * it feeds the SYSTEM PROMPT through emotionMemory, so a wrong answer here does
 * not mis-colour a label on screen — it makes the companion reply to a feeling
 * the user never expressed.
 *
 * The same four defects mobile carried, in TWO places here: the chat page's
 * mood hint AND api/analyze, the server path that PERSISTS the emotion record.
 *
 * Four separate defects:
 *
 *   1. ENGLISH-ONLY. The whole positive branch was
 *        GRATITUDE_REGEX.test(raw) || /\b(hope|happy|joy|…)\b/.test(lower)
 *      GRATITUDE_REGEX covers thanks-words in every script, but "happy" and
 *      "calm" existed in English alone. খুশি · खुश · சந்தோஷ · సంతోష · ಸಂತೋಷ ·
 *      സന്തോഷ · ખુશ · ਖੁਸ਼ · ଖୁସି · आनंद matched NOTHING. A user writing
 *      "আমি আজ খুব খুশি" was read as having expressed no feeling at all.
 *
 *   2. 🔴 NO NEGATION GUARD ANYWHERE. "I'm not happy" contains "happy", is not
 *      caught by EN_SAD_RE, and so came out as primary "hopeful" — the exact
 *      opposite of what was said. Web has guarded this since analyticsEmotion
 *      (`isNegated`); mobile had nothing.
 *
 *   3. JOY COLLAPSED INTO "hopeful", although "joy" is already a supported
 *      local primary — the emoji-only path returns it, and both
 *      getDefaultIntensityForPrimary and mapUserEmotionForTTS handle it. So
 *      "I'm so happy" was spoken back in the gratitude TTS style.
 *
 *   4. THE CLASSIFIER WAS UNTESTABLE, living inline in a 4,000-line screen with
 *      nothing exported. That is why part one could be tested and this could
 *      not. The vocabulary now sits in keywordMaps beside the sad maps.
 *
 * ⚠️ WIDENING THESE MAPS IS A REPLY CHANGE. Every pattern here is a word that
 * means the feeling and little else, and the negative cases at the bottom are
 * load-bearing: they are what keeps precision from being traded away later.
