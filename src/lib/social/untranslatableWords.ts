//
// 🔴 WHY THIS FILE EXISTS, from the first post the pool ever produced.
//
// Asked for "a feeling English has no word for", the model wrote:
//
//   "The Tamil word 'உற்சாகம்' (urchagam) means the quiet lift you feel when
//    something small goes right."
//
// ⛔ As far as anyone here can tell, that is wrong. உற்சாகம் is a Sanskrit loan
// (उत्साह) meaning enthusiasm or zeal — energetic, not quiet — and English
// translates it perfectly well as "enthusiasm", so it is not untranslatable at
// all. The pool's own instructions said in capitals to use ONLY a word the
// writer was certain of. The model ignored it on attempt one.
//
// 🔑 AND NO GATE COULD HAVE CAUGHT IT. Every other check in this system
// compares text against a list of things not to say. There is no list that
// knows whether a translation is TRUE. The only fix is to stop the model
// choosing the word ⇒ it now picks from this table, which a person filled in.
//
// ⚠️ THE HARM IS SPECIFIC, which is why this is not treated as a typo. A wrong
// gloss of a Tamil word is read by Tamil speakers — exactly the people the
// post is courting — as a brand that will happily say things about their
// language without checking ⇒ native_speakers_should_audit_real_replies.
